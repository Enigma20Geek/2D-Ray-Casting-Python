# 2D-Ray-Casting-Python
Most basic implementation of 2D Ray Casting in Python.

If you do know some basics of Game Development, you will definitely have heard about Ray Casting. It's one of the most important concept in Game Development. So, I decided to give it a try.
In this version I used Vector Algebra to solve the Nearest Intersection Point Problem and that turned out to be really easy to implement indeed once you have figured out the maths. It did have one very critical bug which took me 3 hours to get rid of, actually 15 minutes to fix it and rest time to find it :p.
Feel free to share your suggestions.
I hope you like it ;).
